 * Turn these images into a grid of avatar 'polaroids' that spans the entire  container.
 *
 * Create a reusable mixin called `cardGrid` which allows you to specify the maximum amount of polaroids per row, and the amount of margin that separates them as a percentage.
 *
 * Extra: Make it responsive with 5 images displayed for a width of 1200px or more, and 3 if less.
 *
 * Basic CSS normalize is already applied, and other overrides are set in the layout.scss file
